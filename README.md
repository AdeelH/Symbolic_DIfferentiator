# symbolic-differentiator
Given f(x), computes df(x)/dx and algebraically simplifies the result as much as possible. (class assignment for Numerical Analysis, Fall 2014)


## Usage
```
$ python differentiation.py
f(x) = sin(2*x)
Differentiating...
f'(x) = 2.0*(cos(2.0*x))
```
Enter the function, f(x) at the prompt and hit enter.
